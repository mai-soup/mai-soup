## What I'm working on

* __#100daysofcode__ - asides from university work, trying to code at least a bit for 100 days this year. As good a New Year's resolution as any.

## ðŸ’» Currently Learning

* [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) (currently up to and including Data Analysis with Python, as well as the Relational Database course)
* Getting started with 2D game development in ~~Unity~~ Godot, only following tutorials for now to understand how it works but looking forward to making my own original stuff
* Playing around with Node.js and Express in my free time
* Reading on the theory of software engineering, including Agile methods and project management
* Exploring the fundamentals of networking and the Web, inspired by the Networks module I took last year.
